The O language is a system programming language crafted to be remarkably simple
and flexible. It stands not as a replacement for C, but rather as a
complementary counterpart, as both can coexist within the same source code. O
language boasts minimal abstraction, ensuring seamless integration with C and
almost predictable machine code.

olang is a deterministic system language that follows tree principles:

- **fights complexity** by providing a simple syntax with a low level of abstraction.
- **doesn't babysit programmers**, it gives you the freedom of shooting your own foot.
- **aims easy maintainability** by providing a syntax with a low refactoring overhead.

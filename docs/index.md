The zero programming language.

## olang manifest

We, as developers, value the modern programming languages that allow us to
produce reliable code in a short time span. However, we, as programmers, also
lament that these same languages have diminished the joy of programming by
imposing unnecessary constraints and complexities on our creative expression.

That is why we are creating a new programming language that may not be suitable
for most commercial applications, but that can be enjoyed in the places where
it is meant to be used: on system applications.

olang is a deterministic system language that follows two principles:

- **olang fights complexity** by providing a simple syntax with a low level of abstraction;
- **olang doesn't babysit programmers** and therefore the compiler only checks semantics.
